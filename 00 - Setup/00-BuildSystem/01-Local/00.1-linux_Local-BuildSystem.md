To setup linux local build system, you will need to follow these steps:
# Linux Local Build System Setup
## Prerequisites
- A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands
- C++ compiler (g++, clang, etc.) installed
- CMake installed (version 3.10 or higher)
- Git installed
  
## Setup Steps
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Open your terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake git
   ```
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. **Create a Build Directory**:
   Inside the cloned repository, create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. **Configure the Project**:
   Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
   This command will generate the necessary build files in the `build` directory.
5. **Build the Project**:
   After configuring the project, you can build it by running:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will compile the source code and create the executable files in the `build` directory.
6. **Run the Executable**:
   Once the build is complete, you can run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./<executable-name>
   ```
   Replace `<executable-name>` with the name of the generated executable file.
7. **Clean the Build** (Optional):
   If you want to clean the build files, you can run:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
   This will remove the generated files and allow you to start fresh with the next build.
## Additional Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the commands, especially when installing packages.
- If you encounter any issues during the build process, check the CMake output for errors and ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
