To setup windows local build system, you will need to follow these steps:
# Windows Local Build System Setup
## Prerequisites
- A Windows operating system (Windows 10 or later)
- Basic knowledge of command prompt or PowerShell commands
- C++ compiler (Visual Studio with C++ development tools installed)
- CMake installed (version 3.10 or higher)
## Setup Steps
1. **Install Visual Studio**:
   - Download and install Visual Studio from the [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
   - During installation, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload to install the necessary C++ tools.
2. **Install CMake**:
   - Download CMake from the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install CMake.
   - Ensure that you add CMake to your system PATH during installation.
3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <repository-directory>
     ```
4. **Create a Build Directory**:
   - Inside the cloned repository, create a build directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ```
5. **Configure the Project**:
   - Run CMake to configure the project. You can use the following command in Command Prompt or PowerShell:
     ```bash
     cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
     ```
   - Replace `"Visual Studio 16 2019"` with the appropriate generator for your version of Visual Studio.
6. **Build the Project**:
   - After configuring the project, you can build it by running:
     ```bash
     cmake --build . --config Release
     ```
   - This will compile the source code and create the executable files in the `build` directory.
7. **Run the Executable**:
   - Once the build is complete, you can run the executable. You can find the executable in the `Release` or `Debug` folder inside the `build` directory, depending on the configuration you chose.
     ```bash
     .\Release\<executable-name>.exe
     ```
   - Replace `<executable-name>` with the name of the generated executable file.
8. **Clean the Build** (Optional):
   - If you want to clean the build files, you can run:
     ```bash
     cmake --build . --target clean
     ```
   - This will remove the generated files and allow you to start fresh with the next build.
## Additional Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the commands, especially when installing packages.
- If you encounter any issues during the build process, check the CMake output for errors and ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- You can also use the Visual Studio IDE to open the generated solution file (`.sln`) in the `build` directory and build the project from there.
